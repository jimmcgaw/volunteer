Before running rake db:migrate, you need to create the database. Log in to MySQL as root, set up the following two databases and user:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE volunteer_development CHARACTER SET utf8;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE USER 'volunteer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'v0lunt33r';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL ON volunteer_development.* TO 'volunteer'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE DATABASE volunteer_test CHARACTER SET utf8;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL ON volunteer_test.* TO 'volunteer'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
